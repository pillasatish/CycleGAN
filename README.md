# CycleGAN
In the project we are using one of the popular algorithms (CycleGan) to convert human faces to cat and dogs faces. 
***
The project has been written in Python and consists in a Jupyter notebook(google colab) containing both the source code and the project documentation.

The main Python libraries used to design the source code are scikit-learn, scikit-image, Keras and tensorflow. 

**CODE**
The CycleGAN_B21047209_SATISH_PILLA.IPNYB file contains the source code for the entire project. For line of the code there is clear instruction of why were are running the particular code block.

**Report**
CycleGAN_B210472095_SATISH_PILLA.pdf is the overall report of the project. The report is organized as follows:

1 Introduction	

2 Results
